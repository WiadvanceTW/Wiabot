Wiabot is a Teams Bot, which helps users to send Proactive Notification messages to users who have Teams Bot installed through the API interface. In application scenarios such as the recent outbreak of COVID19, companies use internal systems to connect APIs, and regularly send push messages through Teams Bot every day to remind employees to conduct COVID19 surveys and track the health of each company employee.
